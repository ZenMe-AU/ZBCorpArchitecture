# Adapter Pattern

## Overview
Intent: Bridge incompatible interfaces between providers so one workflow can span cloud boundaries. Problem: Certificate issuance and DNS validation workflows require orchestration across AWS ACM and Azure DNS semantics. Trade-Offs: Adapter-style integration enables hybrid operation but increases coupling to both provider API behaviors. Wikipedia Reference: [Adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern).

## Implementation
Certificate requests are created in AWS and validated by DNS records managed in Azure in [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf#L215), [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf#L227), and [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf#L247).

Azure DNS aliases then route traffic to CloudFront endpoints in [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf#L742).

## Future enhancements
- Isolate provider-specific logic behind module interfaces to reduce direct coupling.
- Add integration checks that verify DNS and certificate state before CloudFront updates.
