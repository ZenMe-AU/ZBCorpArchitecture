# Idempotence

## Overview
Intent: Ensure repeated deployment runs converge to the same intended state without duplicate side effects. Problem: Environments can already contain resources created outside Terraform state, causing collisions on first managed run. Trade-Offs: Import-first flows reduce destructive changes but add script complexity and reliance on provider lookups. Wikipedia Reference: [Idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).

## Implementation
Stage scripts check for existing resources and import them into state before apply, including [corpSetup/c01subscription.js](../../corpSetup/c01subscription.js#L150), [corpSetup/c02globalGroups.js](../../corpSetup/c02globalGroups.js#L173), and [corpSetup/c05rootrg.js](../../corpSetup/c05rootrg.js#L179).

The process is also stated as an idempotent behavior in [corpSetup/README.md](../../corpSetup/README.md#L108).

## Future enhancements
- Capture import operations in a structured log for audit and troubleshooting.
- Add dry-run reconciliation output that reports expected imports before execution.
