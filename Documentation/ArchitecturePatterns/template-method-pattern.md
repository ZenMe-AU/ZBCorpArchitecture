# Template Method Pattern

## Overview
Intent: Reuse a common orchestration skeleton while allowing stage-specific preflight and import behavior. Problem: Each deployment stage follows similar lifecycle operations but needs different preparation logic. Trade-Offs: Shared flow improves consistency, but script inheritance-by-convention can hide stage differences if not documented. Wikipedia Reference: [Template method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern).

## Implementation
The shared lifecycle is implemented in [corpSetup/initCorpEnvDeploy.js](../../corpSetup/initCorpEnvDeploy.js#L155), with per-stage functions handling custom prechecks and imports, for example [corpSetup/c05rootrg.js](../../corpSetup/c05rootrg.js#L159) and [corpSetup/c25cloudfront.js](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront.js#L184).

Each stage script plugs into the common runner and contributes stage-specific logic before Terraform execution.

## Future enhancements
- Standardize stage hook contracts with explicit input and output schemas.
- Add validation tests that assert required preflight hooks exist for each stage.
