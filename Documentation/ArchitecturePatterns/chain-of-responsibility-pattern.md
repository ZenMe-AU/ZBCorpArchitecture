# Chain-of-Responsibility Pattern

## Overview
### Intent
Apply request/response processing as a sequence of handlers with separated responsibilities.

### Problem
Edge delivery needs independent authentication and header mutation steps without merging concerns into one function.

### Trade-Offs
Handler separation improves clarity and evolution, but increases orchestration points and deployment artifacts.

## Implementation
CloudFront behavior associates distinct Lambda@Edge functions for viewer-request and viewer-response in [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf#L403) and [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/main.tf#L408).

The response handler applies CORS mutations in [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/source/rewriteHeaderLambdaEdge/index.mjs](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/source/rewriteHeaderLambdaEdge/index.mjs#L8), while the request handler performs token checks in [corpSetup/c25cloudfront/source/authGuardLambdaEdge/index.mjs](../../corpSetup/c25cloudfront/source/authGuardLambdaEdge/index.mjs#L121).

## Future enhancements
- Define a handler contract matrix for shared headers and error semantics.
- Add integration tests to assert handler order and composed response behavior.
