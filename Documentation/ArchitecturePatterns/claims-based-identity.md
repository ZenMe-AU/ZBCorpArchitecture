# Claims-Based Identity

## Overview
Intent: Grant access based on identity claims mapped to application roles and federation contracts. Problem: AWS role access must be derived from Entra identities with predictable claim semantics. Trade-Offs: Claims mapping centralizes authorization logic but requires careful claim contract governance across providers. Wikipedia Reference: [Claims-based identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity).

## Implementation
Entra group-to-app-role assignments are provisioned in [corpSetup/c21awsentrassoP2/group.tf](../../corpSetup/c21awsentrassoP2/group.tf#L9).

Custom SAML claims policy and role assertion transformations are defined in [corpSetup/c21awsentrassoP2/policy.tf](../../corpSetup/c21awsentrassoP2/policy.tf#L154) and [corpSetup/c21awsentrassoP2/policy.tf](../../corpSetup/c21awsentrassoP2/policy.tf#L168).

## Future enhancements
- Add contract tests that validate expected claim output against representative users/groups.
- Track policy versioning and rollout impact across relying parties.
