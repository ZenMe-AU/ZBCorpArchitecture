# Composite Pattern: Progressive Platform Bootstrap

## Overview
### Intent
Bootstrap an environment progressively from foundational subscription setup through delivery layers using staged orchestration.

### Problem
Multi-domain infrastructure dependencies require controlled sequencing and state handoff across stages.

### Trade-Offs
Progressive rollout reduces blast radius and improves diagnosability, but increases orchestration complexity and lead time.

## Implementation
The stage orchestrator drives sequential execution and shared lifecycle behavior in [corpSetup/initCorpEnvDeploy.js](../../corpSetup/initCorpEnvDeploy.js#L161).

Idempotent imports and state adoption in foundational stages are handled in [corpSetup/c02globalGroups.js](../../corpSetup/c02globalGroups.js#L173) and [corpSetup/c05rootrg.js](../../corpSetup/c05rootrg.js#L179).

Cross-stage environment output propagation is persisted through [corpSetup/initCorpEnvDeploy.js](../../corpSetup/initCorpEnvDeploy.js#L228).

## Future enhancements
- Define explicit stage contracts with required inputs and produced outputs.
- Add resumable checkpoints per stage to reduce rerun cost after failures.
