# Data-Driven Programming

## Overview
### Intent
Generate identity resources from declarative tabular inputs instead of hardcoded per-user logic.

### Problem
User and group onboarding must scale while staying consistent and auditable.

### Trade-Offs
Input-driven provisioning is flexible, but malformed data can propagate quickly without strict validation.

## Implementation
User and group records are parsed and transformed from CSV into Terraform maps in [corpSetup/c07userAccounts/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c07userAccounts/main.tf#L36) and [corpSetup/c07userAccounts/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c07userAccounts/main.tf#L123).

Provisioning and relationship assignment then materialize resources from these structures in [corpSetup/c07userAccounts/main.tf](../../corpSetup/c07userAccounts/main.tf#L162).

## Future enhancements
- Add explicit schema validation and duplicate detection before plan/apply.
- Add preview reports that summarize user and group deltas per run.
